# Friend_Finder

This is a faux social networking/match making application.

Users are first presented with a homepage that is formatted using Bootstrap and are provide with a button to take a survey.

Upon clicking, the user is directed to a survey where they are asked to enter their name, provide a link to a photo, followed by 10 statements. Users are asked to select a value between 1 (strongly disagree) and 5 (strongly agree) for each of the 10 questions. 

Once completed, the user clicks submit and the application will display the 'friend' that is the best match based on the users responses.

This application was a great introduction into express and deploying applications via Heroku. The app also relies heavily on Javascript, HTML, NodeJS Bootstrap and multipe NPMs.
